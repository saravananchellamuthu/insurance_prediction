# Health Care Insurance Premium Prediction

## Context

Now a days, healthcare firms utilize personal health data of insurance holders to predict individual health insurance premiums. The premium amount varies from person to person, as numerous factors influence the cost of a health insurance policy. For instance, age plays a significant role, where younger individuals are less likely to have major health problems compared to older ones, leading to higher treatment expenses for older individuals. Consequently, older individuals are required to pay higher premiums than younger ones. Apart from age, several other factors also impact health insurance premiums.

## Content

We have developed a comprehensive system that utilizes various techniques to estimate the required amount of insurance premium based on individual health situations. The dataset consists of 1338 records with 7 attributes, and the data is stored in a structured format within a CSV file.

## Abstract

This project aims to predict an individual's medical bill expenses based on their health conditions, providing them with the ability to focus on their well-being without the burden of financial worries. We evaluated the performance of five regression models, namely Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, Random Forest Regression, Gradient Boosting Regression, and KNN, to identify the most effective one. The models were trained using a comprehensive dataset, enabling accurate predictions. Comparison with actual data verified the model's accuracy, and the best-performing model was selected for deployment. This approach ensures a reliable and efficient solution for predicting medical bill expenses.

## **There is rise in demand for Health Care Insurance Premium in the recent years !!**

- According to a study by the Peterson Center on Healthcare and the Kaiser Family Foundation (KFF), **U.S. healthcare spending rose nearly a trillion dollars from 2009 to 2019,** when adjusted for inflation.
- A recent study reported that **U.S. healthcare spending during 2019 was nearly $3.8 trillion, or $11,582 per person**. By 2028, these costs are expected to climb to $6.2 trillionâ€”roughly $18,000 per person.
- According to the American Medical Association (AMA), **healthcare costs are rising by about 4.5% a year.**

## Objective

The primary objective of this project is to create an application that predicts medical expenses for individuals based on their health information. This prediction is achieved using machine learning-based regression models on input data. The proposed solution aims to estimate insurance premiums based on people's health data, providing valuable insights for insurance companies and individuals.

## Attribute Information

- age - Insurance holder's age in years
- sex - Gender of the insurance holder (Male or Female)
- bmi - BMI stands for Body Mass Index, the ideal range according to height and weight is 18.5 to 24.9
- children - Number of children
- smoker - Whether the insurance holder is a smoker or not
- region - Residential area of the person
- expenses - Individual medical costs billed by health insurance

## Tasks Performed

### 1. Data exploration:

Explored the dataset using Python libraries such as pandas, numpy, matplotlib, and seaborn to gain insights into the data.

### 2. Exploratory Data Analysis :

Conducted EDA by plotting various graphs to better understand the relationships between dependent and independent features.

### 3. Feature Engineering :

Performed feature engineering, including scaling numerical data and encoding categorical data to prepare it for model building.

### 4. Model Building :

Divided the data into training and testing sets and used multiple algorithms for model training, including:<br>

- Linear Regression
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- KNN

### 5. Model Selection :

Evaluated all the models using performance metrics such as Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE) and R-squared, and selected the best-performing model for deployment.

### 6. Web Application & Deployment :

Developed a web application using the Streamlit API to take user inputs and display the predicted output.

## Conclusion

The system demonstrates the utilization of various techniques to estimate the premium amount based on an individual's health condition. It evaluates the impact of factors such as smoking habits and gender on the premium amount. By employing different regression models for prediction, Gradient Boosting emerged as the most accurate model for this task. Our predictions provide users with insights into the expected medical expenses required for purchasing insurance premium and also assist healthcare organizations in determining insurance charges based on an individual's current health condition. This solution aims to offer transparency and informed decision-making for both individuals and healthcare providers in the insurance domain.
